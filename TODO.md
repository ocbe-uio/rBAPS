For the first stable release of rBAPS, the following features should be implemented:

- [] Clustering of populations (import `greedyPoPMix.m` from BAPS)
- [] Clustering of individuals (import `greedyMix.m` from BAPS)
- [] Spatial clustering of populations (import `spatialPoPMixture.m` from BAPS)
- [] Spatial clustering of individuals (import `spatialMixture.m` from BAPS)
- [] Admixture analysis (import `admix1.m` from BAPS)

Note to contributors: as tasks get finished, please update this file with an `x` and keep it there. This should help us fill out a changelog for an eventual stable release.
