Description: Bayesian statistical methods for the estimation of hidden genetic structure of populations have gained considerable popularity in the recent years. Utilizing molecular marker data, Bayesian mixture models attempt to identify a hidden population structure by clustering individuals into genetically divergent groups, whereas admixture models target at separating the ancestral sources of the alleles observed in different individuals. rBAPS provides a computationally efficient method for the identification of admixture events in the population history. It is based on the BAPS software available at <http://www.rni.helsinki.fi/~jic/bapspage.html>.
